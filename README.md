# clarifai-ios-starter
This is a simple project to get you started using the Clarifai API from iOS.


## Building and Running
This project uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). To build and run:
1. Install dependencies and generate workspace.
  ```
  pod install
  ```

2. Open the workspace in XCode
  ```
  open ClarifaiApiDemo.xcworkspace
  ```

3. Press the "Play" button in the toolbar to build, install, and run the app.


## Next steps.
Feel free to use this project as a base for building your app. Alternately, you can copy
`ClarifaiClient.h` and `ClarifaiClient.m` into a new project.  Example usage of ClarifaiClient
can be found in `RecognitionViewController.m`.
